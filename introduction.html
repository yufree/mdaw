- Experimental Design
- Sample collection

- Data Analysis
]

---

## Idea

- Metabolomics would cover unknown compounds
- Study would cover nothing without purpose

&gt; Garbage in, garbage out

### Common Goals

- Methodology/validation
- Diagnose/prediction
- Bio-process/explanation

&gt; Validation is hard for unknown compounds

---
## Experimental Design

### Homogeneity 

- Technical replicates

        - all samples are from same population
        - research purpose is about method in most cases

- Biological replicates

        - all samples are from same population with same biological process
        - research purpose is about biological process
        - technical replicates could also be used with biological replicates

---
## Experimental Design

### Heterogeneity

- Outlier detection/Cross-section study

        - Inner relationship among known/unknown compounds
        - Baseline
        
- Distribution/Spatial analysis

        - Geological relationship of known/unknown compounds
        
- Time Series/Cohort study

        - Temporal trend of known/unknown compounds
        - Baseline

- Clinical Tril

---
## Experimental Design

### Power Analysis

- Power = 1 - False Negative

        - Probability of finding an effect that is there
        - Fixed effects, get sample size to show differences among groups
        - Fixed power, get effects to show differences among groups
        - Prelimitary experiment required

- Simulation to estimate the sample size

]

???
The numbers of samples in each group should be carefully calculated. Supposing the metabolites of certain biological process only have a few metabolites, the first goal of the experimental design is to find the differences of each metabolite in different group. For each metabolite, such comparison could be treated as one t-test. You need to perform a Power analysis to get the numbers. For example, we have two groups of samples with 10 samples in each group. Then we set the power at 0.9, which means 1 minus Type II error probability, the standard deviation at 1 and the significance level(Type 1 error probability) at 0.05. Then we get the meaningful delta between the two groups should be higher than 1.53367 under this experiment design. Also we could set the delta to get the minimized numbers of the samples in each group. To get those data such as the standard deviation or delta for power analysis, you need to perform pre-experiments.

## Sample Collection

### Quenching
        
        - Instantaneous inactivation of metabolism
        - rapid low/high temprature
        - Organic solvent

### Storage

        - -80°C or -20°C
        - Dry ice

Quenching is always discussed for microorganism or cell related metabolomics.
Storage is always concerned by tissue related study.

## Pretreatment

- From samples to injection vials

- More **interesting** compounds, less **unrelated** interference (matrix effects)

- Remove lipid

  - Gel Permeation Chromatograph(GPC)
  - Florisil
  - Alumina
  - Silica gel
  
- Protein denaturation
  
  - Alcohols
  - Strong acid/base

]

???
Pretreatment should fit the purpose of your research. For metabolomics, common unrelated interference are hard to define. Usually, we need to remove lipid and make protein denaturation to release more compounds.

---

## Pretreatment

- Different pretreatment would show different coverage of compounds

  - solvent/sorbent/coating
  - extraction time
  - temperature
  
- Free concentration v.s. binding constants

- Living system: *in vivo* SPME

???
No method could cover all the interesting compounds. The form of the compounds would also matters

---
## Instrumental Analysis

- Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)

  - structural identification
  - little or no sample preparation
  - highly reproducible results

- Gas/Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry(XCMS)

  - high sensitivity
  - high selectivity
  - multi-stage mass spectrometry

---
## Instrumental Analysis - GC-MS

### Column and Temperature Selection

- Higher temperature, higher boiling point
- Polarity of samples and column should match
- Funtional groups of stationary phase matters
  
&gt; How to select column and temperature to seperate polar compounds?

---
## Instrumental Analysis - LC-MS

### Column and Gradient Selection

- More polar solvent could release polar compounds
- More non-polar solvent could release non-polar compounds
- Normal-phase: non-polar compounds first, polar compounds make separation
- Reversed-phase: polar compounds first, non-polar compounds make separation

&gt; Gradient from polar to non-polar make a better seperation on ____ compounds on a reversed-phase column

???
pretreatment method should fit the instrumental analysis methods
---

## Instrumental Analysis - Quality Control

- Random injection sequence
- Calibration for high resolution mass spectrum in real time
- The cap of sequence should old the column with Pooled QC:

  - Blank, Blank, Blank 
  - Solvent Blank, Solvent Blank, Solvent Blank
  - Pooled QC, Pooled QC, Pooled QC
  - Instrumental QC, blank
  
- Every ten random samples as a block
- Blocks are separated by this sub-sequence 

  - Block1
  - Blank, Pooled QC, Instrumental QC
  - Block2

&gt; Compute the volume of pooled QC before started!!!

???
Instrumental QC show the stability of instrument; blank show the baseline of column; Solvent Blank show the baseline of column and solvent; Pooled QC show the baseline of all compounds

]

???
In mass spectrum dataset, the EIC is not that simple for full scan. Due to the accuracy of instrument, the detected mass to charge ratio would have some shift and EIC would fail if different scan get the intensity from different mass to charge ratio. In the matchedfilter algorithm, they solve this issue by bin the data in m/z dimension. The adjacent chromatographic slices could be combined to find a clean signal fitting fixed second-derivative Gaussian with full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of 30s to find peaks with about 1.5-4 times the signal peak width. The the integration is performed on the fitted area.

ROI means a regine with stable mass for a certain time. When we find the ROIs, the peak shape is evaluated and ROI could be extended if needed.

???
Loess alignment use local region to align the peaks. However, obiwarp alignment with bijective interpolated dynamic time warping. Raw data from two LC−MS runs, whether successive fractions or across different biological conditions, (1) is interpolated into a (2) uniform matrix (or rectilinear matrix). (3) An all vs all similarity matrix of the spectra is constructed. (4) The similarity matrix distribution is mean centered and normalized by the standard deviation. (5) Dynamic programming is performed by adding similarity scores along a recursively generated optimal path while off-diagonal transitions are penalized by either a local or global gap penalty to give (6) an additive score matrix. (7) Pointers are kept in a traceback matrix used to deliver (8) the optimal alignment path. (9) High scoring points in the optimal path are selected to create a bijective (one-to-one) mapping, which is used as anchors for PCHIP interpolation to generate a smooth warp function. (II) Verification and optimization. (11) MS/MS spectra from the raw MS runs are searched via SEQUEST and Peptide/Protein Prophet to determine peak identities. (12) High-confidence identifications are selected and (13) the overlapping set of peptide identifications (after filtering outliers) is used as the alignment standard. (14) The warp function produced through the comparison of MS data is applied to the standards. (15) The ideal alignment would shift all standards to the diagonal. The accuracy of an alignment is calculated as the sum of the square residuals from the diagonal.

## Statistic Analysis v.s. Description

### Mass spectrums differences

&lt;img src="https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/diffplot.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- NOT statistical comparison

- Useful for exploratory analysis

- Single sample is not enough

---

## Summary

- ### Each sample need peak-picking algorithm to get peaks

- ### Peaks should be aligned and grouped by retention time

- ### Samples without certain peaks should be filled with noise

- ### Peaks list is the beginning of Statistical analysis
